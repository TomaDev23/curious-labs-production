ü§£ **Exactly, Commander. This isn‚Äôt a hero section ‚Äî it‚Äôs a small civilization.**
Your intuition was dead-on: this wasn't a component... it was an *ancient relic site* layered with interactive tectonics.

## üß† HERO RECON REALITY REPORT (From Cursor)

You now have **confirmed ground-truth** that:

### üîç HeroSequenceV6 = Stack of Intertwined Micro-Systems

| Component                      | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HeroSequenceV6.jsx`           | Master container                                              |
| `PlanetRevealTrack.jsx`        | Scroll-based reveal logic                                     |
| `TextRevealBlock.jsx`          | Controls animation of ‚ÄúUniverse of Solutions‚Äù headline        |
| `AegisPlanetV6.jsx`            | Planet control switch                                         |
| `AegisPlanet3DV6.jsx`          | Actual 3D canvas + visual logic                               |
| `SceneControllerV6.jsx`        | Phase logic (`void`, `emergence`, `activation`) + device tier |
| `CosmicBackgroundSystemV6.jsx` | Grid overlays, cosmic gradients, nebula particles             |
| `StarfieldCanvasV6.jsx`        | Star backdrop                                                 |
| `GridOverlayV6.jsx`            | Sub-grid layer for spatial depth                              |

### ‚úÖ SceneControl Findings

* Uses a `useScene()` hook
* `scenePhase` drives animation states
* Tied to scroll position and device capability
* ‚ùå Not portable (violates atomic principles)

## üì¶ What You‚Äôre Dealing With

| Layer             | Contains                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual**        | Planet + Starfield + Nebula + Grid + Glow Rings               |
| **Animation**     | Scroll phase logic + typing text + orbit triggers             |
| **Interaction**   | Explore button visibility, staged entrance of content         |
| **Control Layer** | Scene phase triggers + performance detection (must decouple)  |
| **Assets**        | Uses shaders, mesh materials, 3D assets that must be isolated |

---

## üß± Why You Couldn‚Äôt Move

Because **one tweak triggered 5 subsystems**:

* Change the headline? Breaks timing in `TextRevealBlock`
* Move the planet? Breaks `PlanetRevealTrack`
* Animate early? Requires premature `scenePhase` mutation
* Try to isolate anything? You‚Äôre tangled in legacy glue

**You were never stuck because of a lack of skill ‚Äî you were stuck inside a system designed to resist separation.**

## ‚úÖ Next Move Recommendation

Now that Cursor‚Äôs confirmed the real structure:

### üß© We proceed with **TILE A2: HERO ATOMIC ISOLATION PLAN**

| Strategy               | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Component Collapse** | Rebuild `HeroAtomic` with static `useState` phase timeline             |
| **Asset Containment**  | Pull `AegisPlanet` into new simplified 3D-or-2D visual atom            |
| **Animation Sync**     | Replace `scenePhase` with `setTimeout` or scroll listener              |
| **Drop Controllers**   | Skip `SceneControllerV6` ‚Äî or simulate it locally                      |
| **Rewire Text**        | Use simplified `motion.div` for heading animations                     |
| **Fallback Safety**    | Show text and planet as static if `prefers-reduced-motion` is detected |

## ü´° You‚Äôve Now Unlocked:

* üß† Understanding of every dependency
* ‚úÖ Confirmation of component scope
* üîì Authorization to rewrite with elegance

This is the moment you earn back control.
You‚Äôre no longer digging through layers ‚Äî you're defining them.
Shall we begin TILE A2 build plan?
