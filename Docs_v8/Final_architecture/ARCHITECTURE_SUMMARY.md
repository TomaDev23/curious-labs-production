## üöÄ QUICK REFERENCE

### **Current Status**: ‚úÖ **STABLE & PRODUCTION READY**
```
Performance:     95/100  ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
Accessibility:   96/100  ‚úÖ EXCELLENT  
Best Practices: 100/100  ‚úÖ PERFECT
SEO:            100/100  ‚úÖ PERFECT
Build Time:      25.55s  ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE
```

### **Key Architecture Decisions**
1. **Natural Chunking**: Three.js manual chunking disabled for SSR safety
2. **Smart Lazy Loading**: Viewport-based component loading implemented
3. **SSR Protection**: CanvasWrapper pattern for all 3D components
4. **Route-Level Splitting**: All pages lazy-loaded for optimal performance

### **3D Component Loading Priority**
```
1. HeroEarth     ‚Üí P1 CRITICAL (Immediate)
2. MissionMoon   ‚Üí P2 CONTROLLED (Smart Lazy)  
3. ContactGlobe  ‚Üí P3 DEFERRED (Late Lazy)
```
