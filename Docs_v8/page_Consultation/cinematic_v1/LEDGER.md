          Unresolved BLOCKING -> owner (via [MGR]).

#L-001  OBSERVATION  [MGR]  2026-09-13T14:00
Run opened. Baseline: main at the "cinematic consultation starting point" commit; work branch `design/cinematic-consultation` created from it and pushed. Page code unchanged since plan pin a49e632 (later commits: tools/art pipeline, create-art skill, design docs only).

#L-002  OBSERVATION  [MGR]  2026-09-13T14:00
Owner decisions (2026-09-13): plan defaults accepted (DEC-02 no general pinning, DEC-03 inline readings, no stand-in people, verified city photo for ART-05, owner updates the tracker .xlsx from reports, phone evidence via the Browser pane) PLUS the dynamic moves in DRAMA_LAYER.md DR-01…DR-09 as progressive enhancement. Hero orbital retained on desktop with the owner-approved option-1 labels (DR-01).

#L-003  STEER  [MGR]  2026-09-13T14:00
[BLD] start at TASKS.md B-00, then B-01 → B-02 in order. B-02 is a pure move — any visible change is a defect. Post START/DONE marks for each task and message the manager on each DONE. Manager is starting M-01…M-04 in parallel (art drafts + copy asks); asset paths are fixed in the TASKS.md asset contract, so code against them now.

#L-004  START  [BLD]  2026-09-13T13:26
ACK #L-003. Starting B-00 (onboard + environment check).

#L-005  DONE  [BLD]  2026-09-13T13:32
B-00 complete. Branch: `design/cinematic-consultation` confirmed via `git branch --show-current` (matches protocol — no BLOCKING). Dev server: `http://localhost:5173/ai-consultation`, tab title "AI Integration Consultation | CuriousLabs" (matches TEAM_PROTOCOL.md). Browser pane: available — page verified at 1440×900 (desktop) and the `mobile` preset (375×812); current pre-refactor hero (glass panel + orbital instrument) renders correctly at both widths. Read TEAM_PROTOCOL.md, LEDGER.md, TASKS.md, DRAMA_LAYER.md, plan v1.0 SC-01…03 + interaction contracts INT-01…10, and `C:/AEGIS/skill_build/orchestrator-mode/references/paired_orchestration.md`. Proceeding to B-01.
