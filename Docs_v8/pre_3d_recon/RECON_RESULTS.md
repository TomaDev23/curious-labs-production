- Threshold controls: Configurable (0.1 default)
```

### **Prime Lazy Loading Candidates**
```
🎯 HIGH-VALUE TARGETS (By bundle size):
1. HUDManager: 269.45 kB → Viewport lazy load
2. HorizontalProductScrollV6: 85.91 kB → Scroll-triggered load
3. Mermaid diagrams: 349.18 kB → On-demand load
4. Cytoscape: 438.65 kB → Component-specific load

## 🔍 PHASE 4: PERFORMANCE MONITORING INFRASTRUCTURE

### **Monitoring System Status**
```
📊 PERFORMANCE MONITOR: src/lib/performanceMonitor.js
- ✅ Bundle size tracking: ACTIVE
- ✅ Route performance: ACTIVE  
- 🔴 Three.js monitoring: DISABLED (ready for reactivation)
- ✅ Device capabilities: ACTIVE
- ✅ Memory tracking: ACTIVE (non-3D components)

🎯 MONITORING READY FOR:
- 3D asset load tracking
- WebGL performance metrics
- Three.js memory usage
- GPU capability detection
```

## 📋 PHASE 5: STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### **HIGH PRIORITY - IMMEDIATE EXECUTION**

**🚀 Phase 3A: 3D Earth Strategic Reintegration**
```
TARGET: HeroAtomic.jsx (11.59 kB → maintain <15 kB with 3D)

IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE:
1. ✅ Typewriter effect: COMPLETED & OPTIMIZED
2. 🟡 3D Earth lazy load: STAGED for implementation
3. 🟡 Performance monitoring: READY for reactivation
4. 🟡 Graceful fallbacks: CONFIGURED

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
- useInViewport hook: Enhance existing useLazyLoad.js
- Three.js bundle: Lazy load after typewriter completion
- WebGL detection: Implement capability-based loading
- Fallback strategy: Static Earth component ready
```

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY - Week 1**

**🎯 Phase 3B: Viewport-Based Component Loading**
```
TARGET COMPONENTS:
- HorizontalProductScrollV6: 85.91 kB → viewport trigger
- HUDManager: 269.45 kB → route-based lazy load
- Diagram components: 20-70 kB each → on-demand load

INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Advanced intersection observers
- Progressive loading strategies
- Performance budget enforcement
- Bundle size alerting
```

## ⚠️ PHASE 6: RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### **Risk Matrix Analysis**

**🔴 HIGH RISK:**
```
1. 3D Bundle Impact: +900KB potential
   MITIGATION: Typewriter delay + progressive loading

2. LCP Regression: 3D blocking main thread
   MITIGATION: requestAnimationFrame + Web Workers

3. Layout Shift: 3D component mounting
   MITIGATION: Reserved space + skeleton loading

4. Device Compatibility: WebGL support variance
   MITIGATION: Capability detection + graceful fallbacks
```

**🟡 MEDIUM RISK:**
```
1. Bundle Size Monitoring: Need continuous tracking
2. Performance Variance: Network/device differences
3. Memory Management: Three.js cleanup requirements
4. SEO Impact: Client-side 3D rendering
```
